Create a simple page with a script that does the following:
1.	Ask the user for his/her name using prompt function, The user must provide a name (no empty strings)
2.	If the user did not type a name, the script should repeat asking for his/her name until a valid string is entered
3.	Ask for a password (123) to continue using prompt function, if the user type the password 3 times incorrectly an alert should appear that “you’ve entered wrong password 3 times”
4.	If the user entered (123) then the script should continue
5.	Ask for the birth month for user, check the month is a number and a correct month; if the user entered an incorrect month repeat till a valid month is entered
6.	Ask for the birth day (day only e.g. 30), check the day is a number and a correct day; if the user entered an incorrect day repeat till a valid day is entered
7.	Display an alert for the user with the correct horoscope
